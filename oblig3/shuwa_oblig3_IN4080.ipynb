    "# IN4080: obligatory assignment 3\n",
    " \n",
    "Mandatory assignment 3 is about the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, you will be tasked to implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system able to answer factual questions based on a document database, more specifically Wiki pages extracted from an [online Star Wars encyclopedia](https://starwars.fandom.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to get at least 12/20 points to pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you have read and are familiar with IFI’s requirements and guidelines for mandatory assignments, see [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-mandatory.html) and [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-guidelines.html).\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment. You should not deliver joint submissions. \n",
    "- You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline (__Friday, October 17 at 23:59__).\n",
    "- Only the last delivery will be read! If you deliver more than one file, put them into a zip-archive. You don't have to include in your delivery the data files already provided for this assignment. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> <b>Practical setup:</b> The preferred way to complete this assignment is using the high-performance computing cluster <i>Fox</i>. See <a href=\"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN4080/h25/computing-setup.html\">here</a> for instructions on how to register and log in to Fox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you cannot work on Fox, you can do the assignment on your machine. In this case, make sure you have installed the following libraries: `pytorch`, `transformers`, `huggingface_hub`,  `bm25s`, `tf_keras`, `sentence-transformers` and either `nltk` or `spacy` (depending on how you prefer to do sentence splitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Gemma LLMs (from Google) are [_gated_](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated), you will also need to:\n",
    "- create a user account on HuggingFace\n",
    "- access the user conditions for [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-1.1-2b-it)\n",
    "- Create an acces token ([here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))\n",
    "- At the start of your notebook, run the following code: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from huggingface_hub import login\n",
    "login(token=\"hf_...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You should deliver a completed version of this Jupyter notebook, containing both your code and explanations about the steps you followed. We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have implemented and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the use of LLMs (ChatGPT or similar): you are allowed to use them as 'sparring partner', for instance to clarify something you have not understood. However, you are __not__ allowed to use them to generate solutions (either in part or in full) to the assignment tasks. \n"

    "whereas in Task 3, the top result becomes:\n",
    "“Blackhole was secretly planning on becoming Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Mindor.”\n",

    "2. This difference arises because Task 2 uses BM25s, which is a bag-of-words (sparse) model that only counts token frequencies and does not capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "Although “Luke Skywalker” appears twice in the Task 2 top result, the sentence is actually about the lightsaber, not the person.\n",

    "3. In Task 3, however, we use dense retrieval, where both the query and corpus sentences are converted into embedding vectors, and their similarity is computed using cosine similarity. This allows the system to capture semantic relatedness rather than just word repitition.\n",

The model frequently misunderstood fictional Star Wars entities as real-world subjects, resulting in generic or irrelevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Task 4 integrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using the HybridRetriever. This significantly improved factual grounding and answer quality. Out of eight evaluation questions, five were fully correct, two were partially correct or safely refused, and none showed hallucination. The model was able to generate accurate, context-aware responses. When the retrieved context did not contain the relevant fact, the model appropriately stated its inability to answer.\n",

    "1. Expand the top k scope (from 5 to 25), this helps to provide more related sentences to the query, thus providing more details which lead to increase the completeness of the response.\n",
    "2. Expand the max_length from 50 to 100, observation shows that max_length=50, some of the response is not complete. So increase the permitted length so as to increase the response completeness. \n",
    "3. Enlarge the corpus, we can see that the last question \"Darth Sidious\" is missing in the corpus, consider to expand the corpus by introducing other star war sources as a complementary to the Star Wars Wiki. \n",
    "4. To further enhance semantic retrieval, domain-adapted or retrieval-optimized embedding models from Hugging Face could be adopted.\n",
    "For example, models like intfloat/e5-base-v2 or multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 are specifically trained for question–answer retrieval tasks and could capture semantic nuances more effectively than the general-purpose all-MiniLM-L6-v2 used in our system.\n",
